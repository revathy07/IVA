Step 1: Feature Extraction from Segmented Objects
1.	Segment the Image
o	Segmentation is the process of dividing an image into parts or regions, usually by separating the objects of interest from the background.
o	How to Do It: Use techniques like thresholding, edge detection, or more advanced methods like watershed or contour-based segmentation.
o	Example:
	Thresholding: Converts the image to binary (black and white) based on a certain intensity value.
2.	Identify the Objects of Interest
o	After segmentation, identify the specific objects in the image. Each object will be a separate region or set of pixels.
o	How to Do It: You can use contours or connected component analysis to label and isolate each object. 
	Contours: Finds the outlines of objects in the image.
3.	Extract Features from Each Object
o	Once the objects are isolated, you can extract features from each segmented object.
Feature Types:
o	Shape Features: Describe the geometry of the object.
	Area: The number of pixels inside the object.
	Perimeter: The length of the boundary of the object.
	Bounding Box: The smallest rectangle that can enclose the object.
	Centroid: The center of the object.
o	Edge Features: Extract edges within the segmented object.
	How to Do It: Apply edge detection (e.g., Canny) only to the pixels within the object's region.
o	Texture Features: Analyze the surface quality of the object.
	How to Do It: Compute texture descriptors like Local Binary Pattern (LBP) or Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for the object's pixels.
o	Color Features: If working with color images, analyze the color distribution within the object.
	How to Do It: Compute color histograms or color moments for the segmented object.
4.	Analyze and Use the Features
o	Once the features are extracted, you can analyze them for tasks like object recognition, classification, or further image analysis.
o	For example, you might compare the shape or texture features of different objects to classify them into categories.
Step 2 : Object Detection using the extracted features
1. Extract Features from a Reference Object
•	First, you need a reference object, which is the object you want to detect in other images.
•	Extract features from this reference object as described previously (shape, edge, texture, color).
2. Extract Features from the Target Image
•	Segment the target image where you want to detect the object.
•	Extract the same set of features from all segmented regions or objects in the target image.
3. Compare Features for Object Detection
•	Compare the features extracted from the reference object with the features extracted from each segmented object in the target image.
•	Use similarity measures to find the closest match. Here’s how you can do it:
Similarity Measures:
•	Euclidean Distance: Compare feature vectors by calculating the Euclidean distance. The smaller the distance, the more similar the objects are.
•	Correlation: Measure the correlation between feature vectors. Higher correlation means higher similarity.
•	Histogram Comparison: If using color histograms, compare them using methods like Chi-square or Intersection.
4. Locate and Identify the Object
•	Once you find the best match (i.e., the segmented object with features most similar to the reference object), you can identify and locate the object in the target image.
•	Mark the detected object using bounding boxes or contours.
5. Visualize the Results
•	Draw the bounding box or highlight the detected object in the target image to show the result of the object detection.
Finally based on the objects and features matching the target image label them and create a labelled dataset.
